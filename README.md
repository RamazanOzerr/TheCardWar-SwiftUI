# Card War

Card War is a simple card game where the user competes against the computer in a battle of luck and strategy. The game involves drawing two random cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, comparing their values, and awarding a point to the winner. The game continues until all 13 cards have been played.

## Gameplay

1. Upon launching the game, the user is presented with a button labeled "Draw Cards".
2. When the user clicks on the "Draw Cards" button, two random cards are drawn from the deck and displayed on the screen.
3. The values of the two cards are compared, and the player with the higher card value wins the round.
4. If the user wins the round, a point is awarded to the user. If the computer wins, a point is awarded to the computer. In case of a tie, no points are awarded.
5. The game continues until all 13 cards have been drawn and played.
6. After all rounds have been completed, the final scores of the user and the computer are displayed.
